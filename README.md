# dengue-ai-competition
Dengue prediction competition from DrivenData.

> **Can you predict local epidemics of dengue fever?**
> 
> Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne disease that occurs in tropical 
> and sub-tropical parts of the world. 
> In mild cases, symptoms are similar to the flu: 
> fever, rash, and muscle and joint pain. 
> In severe cases, dengue fever can cause severe bleeding, low blood pressure, and even death.
> 
> Because it is carried by mosquitoes, the transmission dynamics of dengue are related 
> to climate variables such as temperature and precipitation. 
> Although the relationship to climate is complex, 
> a growing number of scientists argue that climate change is likely 
> to produce distributional shifts that will have significant public health implications worldwide.

### Why Bamboo?
It was the name of a village in the Langtang Trek where
I stopped by when I was in Nepal. 
At the time I felt sick and didn't know what was happening,
later on a blood test confirmed I had dengue.
